Modelisation Project with FEniCS


This project is part of CentraleSupélec curiculum, a french "Grande école". Thus, the document is written in French (you can still look at the code if you only speak english.)

It aims to use an open source partial diferential equation solver: [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/dolfin/1.3.0/python/programmers-reference/fem/solving/solve.html).

This very project focuses on modelizing wind going on a particular mountain profile called [Witch of Agnesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_of_Agnesi) thanks to [Scorer equations](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89quation_de_Scorer)



## How to read it?

- simplest solution: Click on the .ipynb in github. Github is able to display this kind of notebooks (it can be long to load it although) and you will we able to see the pretty cool wind profiles !

- If you want to run this program, install jupyter `pip install jupyter` and install FEniCS (you should follow the official website tutorial, which is often updated)


## Examples

Have fun and enjoy science!
